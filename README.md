## Hi there, I'm [Georgios Liargkovas](https://gliargovas.github.io)! 👋
### Student and Researcher 🎓📚💻

I hold a Bachelor's Degree from **Department of Management Science and Technology** of **Athens University of Economics and Business** (AUEB), Greece. My journey has taken me through research related to software engineering, computer systems, and more, under the guidance of [Prof. Diomidis Spinellis](https://www2.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/) at [BALab](https://www.balab.aueb.gr/). I've also had the privilege to work at **Brown University's Computer Science Department** on the [PaSh project](https://github.com/pash-project/pash) (a shell-script parallelization initiative backed by the Linux Foundation) under [Prof. Nikos Vasilakis](https://nikos.vasilak.is/).

🔍 **Research Interests**:
- **Computer Systems** (focusing on distributed & serverless systems, scheduling, concurrency and file systems)
- **Empirical Software Engineering** (particularly software analytics and mining software repositories)
- **Programming Languages** (with an affinity for compilers & program analysis)
- **Machine Learning** and its convergence with the fields above.

🤝 I cherish intellectual discussions, knowledge exchange, and collaboration. Whether it's the above topics or anything else, feel free to strike up a conversation!
